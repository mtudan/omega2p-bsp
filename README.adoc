= Omega2+ BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: mkdir omega2p-yocto && cd omega2p-yocto
$: repo init -u https://github.com/mtudan/omega2p-bsp.git -b warrior
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build (reference only instructions, use appropriate `<TARGET>` name):

[source,console]
$: source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env
$: ../sources/meta-omega2p/scripts/setup-environment.sh <TARGET>
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `omega2p-yocto/sources`.
